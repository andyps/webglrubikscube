# WebGL Rubik's Cube
Simple WebGL Rubik's Cube game done during js13kGames competition. The fun part of the compo was limitations on build size.
Some code were cut to fit into filesize limits.
Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Edge, IE 11.

# How to play
Use right/middle mouse buttons to rotate camera. You can also use left mouse button to rotate camera but outside the cube.
To zoom camera use mouse wheel.
Use left mouse button on cube to rotate its sides. Middle doesn't move!
Happy solving!
